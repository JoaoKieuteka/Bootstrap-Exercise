This is just a little exercise I did to practice a little bit of bootstrap library for CSS.

The main Idea here is to create the same page from my "exercise-HTML-CSS" repository, the page has some navegation button on the top with a search form from bootstrap, the main has just "lorem" to fill some of the page, It has some cards that has informations about teachers and the users can read some information about them and even hire then.

All the sections are divided with the Grid system that bootstrap provides.
